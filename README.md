# CyberPurge - Automated Review & Action Pipeline


## ðŸš€ Project Overview
CyberPurge is an intelligent and scalable **fraud detection and prevention system** designed to identify, review, and eliminate fraudulent accounts across online platforms. By leveraging **machine learning, real-time reporting, and automated actions**, it ensures a secure digital environment with minimal human intervention.

## ðŸ”¥ Proposed Solution
CyberPurge operates through a **multi-layered risk assessment framework** that continuously monitors and analyzes user activities, behavioral patterns, network anomalies, and content authenticity. The system assigns a **fraud risk score** based on these factors, allowing for dynamic fraud detection with high accuracy.

## Key Components:
- **Risk Scoring Engine** â€“ Assesses fraud probability based on multiple weighted parameters such as profile verification, login history, and social network patterns.
- **Automated Review Pipeline** â€“ Classifies accounts into risk categories, triggering appropriate actions.
  - **Low Risk (0-60%)**: No action required.
  - **Medium Risk (60-80%)**: Sent for human review via a moderation dashboard.
  - **High Risk (80-100%)**: Auto-delete & alert authorities in case of financial fraud.
- **User Reporting Integration** â€“ Allows users to flag suspicious accounts, contributing to real-time fraud detection.
- **AI-Powered Content Analysis** â€“ Uses NLP models to scan for scam keywords and deceptive content.
- **Cross-Platform Blacklisting** â€“ Fraudulent account fingerprints are shared securely across platforms to prevent repeat offenses.
- **Transparency & Moderation Dashboard** â€“ Provides insights into fraud detection decisions and allows human intervention when necessary.

## TechStack:

- **Backend**: Python (FastAPI/Flask) + TensorFlow/PyTorch for ML. -
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for user data, Redis for real-time reporting.
- **Cloud**: AWS/Azure for scalable compute (Lambda for serverless scoring).
- **Integration**: APIs to sync with social media platforms (e.g., Metaâ€™s Graph API for 
Facebook/Instagram).
